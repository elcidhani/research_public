Axioma

Universe

- Country limits
- Regulatory lists
- Exclude max utilisation 80% / DCBS <= 2 / Inventory data
- Clean up ETFs (removed leveraged ETFs)
- Remove European ADR (risk country)
- Illiquid names

Constraints

- Min $25K position size
- Maximise specific risk (85%) / minimise factor risk
- Transaction cost manager: transaction cost and market impact (formula for each country)
- No beta exposure (-5% to 5%), medium term momentum, residual volatility, no long / no short
- Turnover constraint (10%)
- Gross constraint ($100mm)
- Trade-off between specific, gross and turnover
- Unwind constraints
- Industry (-50bps to 50bps), Style (momentum and value), ADV (no limit on the longs, max position size for hedges 20% ADV)
- Single optimisation 5%, max position size 20%
- Hard vs soft constraint

---

Backtest
- split backtest by long vs short returns
- risk premium profile (sort by abs returns then cumsum)
- risk exposure (against barra factor returns)

Signal research
- return decay plot (equal weighted per decile) across 1d, 1w, 1m etc...
- signal/return plot (group by factor, weight avg return)
- signal/return table (custom group by)
- exposure by plot (visualise if top decile sector biased)
- factor attribution
- factor exposure plot
- ic decay (i.e. ic with 1d, 1w, 1m etc... returns)
- time series IC
- mean monthly IC 
- time series IC by group (e.g. market cap, liquidity buckets etc...): group by apply, spearman rank between corr and return. 
- factor score distribution
- factor rank autocorrelation
- Return by quantiles / deciles
